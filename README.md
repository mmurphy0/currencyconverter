Below the entry boxes are buttons to convert the currency from pounds to the desired currency and an exit button if the user wants to exit the program

-> If the currency entered is not supported, the user will be informed of this via a messagebox saying 'Unfortunately, this currency is not supported'

-> If the checks are successful then another window will open showing the user how much the converted amount is
